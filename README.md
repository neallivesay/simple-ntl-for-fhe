# A simple Number Theoretic Library for Fully Homomorphic Encryption

A small library of functions for implementing negacyclic convolution
(aka "polynomial multiplication"), the main operation in (most) Fully
Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) schemes. This library is designed to be
easy to understand and use, and may be used by beginners before
transitioning to high-performance libraries such as HEXL or Shoup's
NTL.
