r"""
A simple Number Theoretic Library for FHE (Python version)

A library to support the implementation of high-performance Number
Theoretic Transforms (NTTs)---i.e., the Fast Fourier Transforms for a
field of prime size---especially in the context of Fully Homomorphic
Encryption (FHE). This library is designed to be small, easy to
understand, easy to use, and have minimal dependencies. Simplicity has
been favored over both performance and generality for functions that do
not have a direct impact on the performance of the Number Theoretic
Transform. Such functions include primality tests, "NTT friendly" prime
generation, and primitive root tests and generation. All algorithms
used are widely known. For more general high-performance number
theoretic libraries, see Shoup's NTL or Intel's HEXL library.

    Determines if `n` is a power of two. Note `n` is a power of two if

    Assume `x` is an integer with length at most `bit_length`. Bit-
    reversal maps `x` to the integer whose binary representation has 
    the same bits, but in reverse order. For example, a 3-bit bit-
    reversal maps the integer 1 (i.e., 001 in binary) to 4 (100), 
    2 (010) to 2 (010), and 3 (011) to 6 (110).

    Returns a primitive `N`th root of unity modulo a prime `q`. Assumes
    `N` is a power of two dividing `q-1` (a standard baseline 
    assumption when implementing the NTT).
    
    Notes
    -----
    Given the assumptions on `N` and `q` above, there are exactly `N`
    `N`th roots of unity modulo `q`, with exactly half being primitive.
    A brute-force approach to finding one of these primitive roots
    might involve searching through all integers from `1` to `q-1` and
    testing if it is a primitive root. As the likelihood of any given
    integer being a root is `(q-1)/N`, this search can be slow when `q`
    is large relative to `N`. The implementation below uses an 
    alternative approach, leveraging the fact that if `x` is nonzero,
    then `x` raised to the power of `(q-1)/N` is always a root. The 
    likelihood of a root being primitive (given the above assumptions)
    is `1/2`.
